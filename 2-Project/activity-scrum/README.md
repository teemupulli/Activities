### Objective:

To gain a practical understanding of Scrum principles by reverse engineering a website and applying Scrum concepts to prototype development.

### Instructions:

1. **Website Exploration:**
   Please visit the website https://www.proshopdemo.dev/ to familiarize yourself with its functionalities.

2. **Reverse Engineering:**
Instead of starting with user stories, you will deduce user stories after exploring the website. For instance, consider actions like registration and login.

Examples:

  - As a user, I want to receive personalized product recommendations based on my browsing and purchase history, so that I can discover relevant products I might be interested in.
  - As a customer, I expect a simple and streamlined checkout process with clear steps, minimal form filling, and the option to review my order before finalizing it.
  - As a registered user, I want to log in quickly using my email and password, ensuring a secure and personalized shopping experience.
  - As a new user, I want to easily sign up for an account using my email and password, so that I can start shopping online.


1. **Team Formation:**
Work in groups and form a Scrum team. Each group member should choose one of the roles in Scrum.

2. **Understanding the Roles:**
Discuss the role of the Product Owner within Scrum. What does a Product Owner do?

3. **Scrum Master's Necessity:**
Consider whether having a Scrum Master is required for this scenario.

4. **Creating User Stories:**
Collaborate to build the product backlog and define user stories. Use the format: "As a ... , I need ..., so that ..."

5. **Sprint Backlog:**
Develop a sprint backlog by breaking user stories into tasks required for the prototype development.

6. **Understanding Burndown Chart:**
Discuss the meaning and significance of a burndown chart in the context of Scrum.

7. **Ceremonies Exploration:**
Discuss the three key Scrum ceremonies: sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review.

8.  **Backlog Clarification:**
Discuss the distinction between the product backlog and the sprint backlog.

2. **Scrum Artifacts:**

   - Sprint Backlog: The tasks the team commits to completing during a sprint.
   - Increment: The sum of all completed items in a sprint.

3. **Reflecting**
- Collaboration within your team is vital for success.
- Apply critical thinking when deriving user stories.
- Reflect on the real-world applications of Scrum principles.
