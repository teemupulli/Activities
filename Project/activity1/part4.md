# DEEP principle 

The DEEP principle in Scrum stands for Detailed, Estimated, Emergent, and Prioritized, and it helps ensure that the product backlog items are well-defined and suitable for inclusion in the upcoming sprints. Here's an analysis of the tasks in the [backlog](./part3.md) to see if they meet the DEEP principle:

1. **Create user registration form with email and password fields.**
   - **Detailed:** This task is detailed enough to understand what needs to be done.
   - **Estimated:** It may require further estimation in terms of time and effort.
   - **Emergent:** It's clear and doesn't require additional context.
   - **Prioritized:** It is a fundamental task for user registration and should be prioritized.

2. **Implement user login system with email and password authentication.**
   - **Detailed:** Clear in its purpose and scope.
   - **Estimated:** Detailed estimation may be needed.
   - **Emergent:** Provides a specific outcome.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user authentication, likely a high priority.

3. **Display clear error messages for incorrect login credentials and duplicate email registrations.**
   - **Detailed:** Clear about what it intends to achieve.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation is straightforward.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly defined.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user experience, should be high priority.

4. **Implement the "Stay Logged In" feature for registered users.**
   - **Detailed:** The purpose is well-defined.
   - **Estimated:** Requires estimation.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly specified.
   - **Prioritized:** A useful feature, priority may depend on user needs.

5. **Develop the "Forgot Password" feature with email-based password reset.**
   - **Detailed:** Clearly defines what is needed.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation is straightforward.
   - **Emergent:** Provides a specific outcome.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user convenience, likely a high priority.

The analysis can continue for the other tasks, but as you can see from these examples, the tasks in the backlog appear to meet the DEEP principle reasonably well. 

6. **Develop product browsing functionality and product detail pages.**
   - **Detailed:** It specifies the purpose but may require more detailed requirements.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation might depend on the specific features within the browsing functionality.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly stated but might need further refinement.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user interaction but should be broken down into smaller tasks.

7. **Design a shopping cart summary with product details and pricing.**
   - **Detailed:** Clear about the intended outcome.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation should be relatively straightforward.
   - **Emergent:** Provides a specific, well-defined outcome.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for the shopping experience and should be a high priority.

8. **Allow users to adjust item quantities and remove items from the cart.**
   - **Detailed:** Clearly specifies the desired functionality.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation might vary based on implementation complexity.
   - **Emergent:** Defines a specific feature.
   - **Prioritized:** Critical for a seamless shopping experience, likely high priority.

9. **Provide clear indications for out-of-stock or unavailable products.**
   - **Detailed:** The purpose is well-defined but may require more specific criteria.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation could be straightforward.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly specified.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user experience and should be a high priority.

10. **Enable continuous shopping without losing the contents of the shopping cart.**
   - **Detailed:** Clear about the desired functionality.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation might depend on the technical implementation.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly defined.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for user convenience, likely a high priority.

11. **Implement real-time updates to the cart total and discounts.**
   - **Detailed:** Defines the purpose but may require more detailed requirements.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation is necessary for implementation planning.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly specified.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for real-time user feedback, priority may vary.

12. **Ensure a seamless transition from browsing to checkout while retaining cart items and details.**
   - **Detailed:** The purpose is clear but might require more specific criteria.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation may depend on the technical complexity.
   - **Emergent:** Provides a specific outcome.
   - **Prioritized:** Crucial for a smooth user experience, likely high priority.

13. **Implement options to remove individual items or clear the entire cart with a single action.**
   - **Detailed:** Clearly defines the desired functionality.
   - **Estimated:** Estimation may vary based on implementation details.
   - **Emergent:** Clearly specified.
   - **Prioritized:** Important for cart management, likely a high priority.



### Recap

- These tasks, appear to meet the DEEP principle reasonably well. 
-They are mostly detailed, clear, and emergent, but some tasks might benefit from more specific criteria or requirements. 
- Estimations may vary, and prioritization should be based on the project's goals and user needs. 
- Regular refinement and review of the backlog are essential to keep it aligned with the project's evolving priorities and requirements.
