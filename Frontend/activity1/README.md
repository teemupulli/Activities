# Es6,  React Styling

This activity comprises two parts, each with its own focus and approach:

1. The first part primarily revolves around `discussing` fundamental concepts `within the group`. The goal is to ensure that everyone possesses a basic understanding of the subject matter.

2. The second part delves deeper into the topic, and it is` advisable` to initiate your exploration `with the support of your group.` However, should you encounter challenges, there is the option to attend the `optional sessions scheduled on Fridays`, where additional assistance is available.

> You don't have to submit the first part related to concepts
